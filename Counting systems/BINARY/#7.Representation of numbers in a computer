To do a operation in bynary system you have to complete bits to 8bits (byte);

Ex : 
 +9 = 00001001+
  8 = 00001000
---------------
+17 = 00010001

==>the last bit '2^8' (in this example) is abpute the signel 0 ==> (+) / 1 ==> (-)

In the first byte :
 ==> the biggest positive number that we can reperesent is (+127)
 ==> the smallest negative number that we cam represent is (-128)
