Q : -49 - 26 = ?

==> first we have to see 49 in binary
  49 = 00110001
==> than we have to determine -49 in binary (using the seconde complement)
 -49 = 11001111

==> We passe through the same process to determine negative of 26
 -26 = 11100110

   -49 = 11001111              remember to delete or ignor the bits more than 8bits.
+                              and the last bit referto the signal of number
  - 26 = 11100110              o = (+)  /  1 = (-)  
                                           
--------------------
   -75 = 10110101
